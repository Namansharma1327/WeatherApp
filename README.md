**Weather Application**


Overview
This is a simple weather application built using React.js that allows users to check the current weather conditions by entering the name of any city across the world. The app fetches weather data from a third-party weather API and displays important weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

•	Search weather by city name: Enter the name of a city, and the app will display the current weather information.
•	Current weather data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and more.
•	Error handling: Shows appropriate error messages for invalid city names or if the weather data cannot be fetched.

Technologies Used
•	React.js: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
•	OpenWeatherMap API: External weather API to fetch the current weather data based on the city name.
•	Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
•	CSS: For styling the application and making it responsive.
